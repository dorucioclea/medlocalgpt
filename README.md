# medlocalgpt

Ask your (medical) dataset privately using LLMs and Embeddings. No data leaves your infrastructure/platform and 100% private.
Optionally you can use OpenAI GPT models or other LLM SaaS solutions.

This project is part of the R&D on intelligent data analysis and computational linguistics for digital health (telerehabilitation an rehabilitation medicine).

## Important note

**medlocalgpt** project and documentation are in active development. For any technical clarifications and questions contact me via email: [malakhovks@nas.gov.ua](mailto:malakhovks@nas.gov.ua) or via Issues. The recent Russian's rocket shelling on critical infrastructure in Ukraine and Kyiv led our server infrastructure to become unstable.
